The vast majority of the files in here contain totally bunk data.
The number of files and the size of the files is intended to approximate
that of the puppetlabs production ops environment, and we will look up
some values during catalog compiles to make sure that the hiera code is
being exercised and that *some* of the yaml files have to be at least
parsed.

As time goes on we might want to try to convert a larger percentage of
this data to keys/values that actually get used in the catalogs.
